# Object-detection-using-YOLO
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Object Detection, a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. It uses deep learning models to classify objects and draw bounding boxes around them.

🎯 Objectives

Detect multiple objects in images or video streams.

Display bounding boxes with object names.

Show how AI can be applied in real-world use cases.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (image & video handling)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (deep learning models, depending on your setup)

Pre-trained Models (YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN)

⚙️ How It Works

Input an image or live video stream.

Pre-trained model scans the image for patterns (edges, shapes, colors).

It outputs object labels + bounding box coordinates.

Display the detected objects on the screen.

🚀 Setup & Installation

Clone or download this project.

Install required packages:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow


(Add torch if using PyTorch.)

Run the main script:

python object_detection.py


The program will open your webcam or process an image file.

🖥️ Example Output

Shows a video or image with boxes around detected objects.

Each box labeled with the object’s name (like “person,” “car,” “dog”).

🌟 Applications

Autonomous Vehicles: Detect cars, pedestrians, and signals.

Security: Track people or items in surveillance.

Healthcare: Detect tumors or anomalies in medical images.

Retail: Recognize products on shelves.

✅ Advantages

Automates tasks that need human vision.

Fast and scalable.

Improves safety, accuracy, and efficiency.

📌 Conclusion

This project showcases how AI can make computers “see” and understand objects in real time. Object Detection is a key technology behind smart systems like self-driving cars, smart cameras, and more.
